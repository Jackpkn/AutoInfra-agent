# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AutoInfra Agent is a zero-touch infrastructure setup system that analyzes uploaded codebases and automatically generates Docker configurations, Kubernetes manifests, CI/CD pipelines, and provides intelligent infrastructure recommendations. The system aims to eliminate the days developers typically spend writing infrastructure configurations by providing automated, optimized solutions based on codebase analysis.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to upload my codebase and receive auto-generated Docker configurations, so that I can containerize my application without writing Dockerfiles from scratch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a codebase THEN the system SHALL analyze the project structure and dependencies
2. WHEN the analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL generate an optimized Dockerfile with multi-stage builds where appropriate
3. WHEN generating Docker configs THEN the system SHALL include .dockerignore files to optimize build context
4. IF the project has multiple services THEN the system SHALL generate docker-compose.yml for local development

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive auto-generated Kubernetes manifests for my application, so that I can deploy to Kubernetes without manually writing YAML configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Docker configurations are generated THEN the system SHALL create corresponding Kubernetes deployment manifests
2. WHEN generating K8s manifests THEN the system SHALL include service, ingress, and configmap resources as needed
3. WHEN the application requires persistence THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate PVC and storage configurations
4. IF the application has environment-specific needs THEN the system SHALL create separate manifests for dev/staging/prod

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive auto-generated CI/CD pipeline configurations, so that I can set up automated builds and deployments without writing pipeline scripts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure manifests are generated THEN the system SHALL create CI/CD pipeline configurations for popular platforms
2. WHEN generating pipelines THEN the system SHALL include build, test, security scan, and deployment stages
3. WHEN creating deployment pipelines THEN the system SHALL include environment promotion workflows
4. IF the project uses specific testing frameworks THEN the system SHALL include appropriate test execution steps

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to receive intelligent infrastructure recommendations, so that I can make informed decisions about cost optimization and scaling strategies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the codebase THEN the system SHALL estimate resource requirements based on application characteristics
2. WHEN providing recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal instance types and scaling configurations
3. WHEN calculating costs THEN the system SHALL provide cost estimates for different cloud providers and configurations
4. IF the application has specific performance requirements THEN the system SHALL recommend appropriate infrastructure patterns

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to detect my application's technology stack and dependencies, so that the generated infrastructure is tailored to my specific needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a codebase is uploaded THEN the system SHALL identify the programming language, framework, and runtime version
2. WHEN analyzing dependencies THEN the system SHALL detect databases, caches, message queues, and external services
3. WHEN identifying the tech stack THEN the system SHALL determine build tools, package managers, and deployment requirements
4. IF the project has microservices architecture THEN the system SHALL detect service boundaries and communication patterns

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to customize the generated infrastructure configurations, so that I can adapt them to my specific requirements and constraints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN infrastructure is generated THEN the system SHALL provide options to modify resource limits and scaling parameters
2. WHEN customizing configurations THEN the system SHALL validate changes for compatibility and best practices
3. WHEN applying customizations THEN the system SHALL regenerate affected configurations automatically
4. IF customizations conflict with best practices THEN the system SHALL warn the user and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to download or integrate the generated configurations into my repository, so that I can use them immediately in my development workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configurations are generated THEN the system SHALL provide download options for individual files or complete packages
2. WHEN downloading configurations THEN the system SHALL include documentation and setup instructions
3. WHEN integrating with repositories THEN the system SHALL support direct commits to Git repositories via API
4. IF the user has existing configurations THEN the system SHALL offer merge strategies to preserve custom changes
